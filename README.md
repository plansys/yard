# Yard: ReactJS Component in PHP

This library allows you to write ReactJS Component in PHP Class.

It works by creating React Component on-the-fly based on javascript generated by PHP. 


### Vanilla PHP Installation

This library someday will be available in composer. In the meantime, you can just download this repository and follow these steps: 

 1. Create `my-project` directory
 2. Create `components` and `redux` directory in `my-project` directory 
 3. Extract `yard-master.zip` in that directory
 4. Rename `yard-master` directory into `yard`
 5. Create `index.php` file
 
After those steps, your directory structure should look like this:

```
my-project
  ├─ components 
  ├─ redux
  └─ yard (~~ renamed from yard-master ~~)
     ├─ js
     ├─ core
     ├─ bridge
     ├─ vendor
     ├─ sample
     └─ ...
  └─ index.php   
 ```
 
 And put this code into `index.php` file:
 
 ```php
 <?php
 
 require("yard/bridge/vanilla.php");
 Yard::render('yarn/sample/Welcome');
 ```
 

Then open `index.php` in your browser.
This will render `Welcome` Component in `/yard/sample/Welcome.php` file.
